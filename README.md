Building networks from oscillations on nodes

## Requirements 
* Python 3.8 (for compaitibility with `pygraphviz`, see below). 
* Install the python packages in requirements.txt using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install Graphviz (used with `networkx` package to visualize graphs)
* Install package `pygraphviz` as described here https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install (note: on Windows, the steps described there fail on Python 3.10 but work on Python 3.8)
